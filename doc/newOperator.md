# Adding a new operator

A guide on how to add a new operator.

## Name and role

Open the **data/names.txt** file and add the operator name, then in the **data/role.txt** file add the role (attacker or defender).

## Weapons

In the **primaryWeapons.txt** and **secondaryWeapons.txt** files add the weapons on the same line as the operator.

## Other data

The rest of the data such as the operator icon are downloaded by the program directly from the website.

## Notes
- In the future i'll make a script that automates this process.
